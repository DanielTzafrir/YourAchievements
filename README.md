I chose to add a feature to the application "Running trainer: tracker&couch".
I used a UI UX designer to design the screen (Figma) and I developed it in Swiftui.
I thought of a way to upgrade the application a little more and the idea is to add competitiveness between the users, by letting the user know where he is ranked compared to the other users in percentages, so that the user's motivation to go the farthest will increase.
The bottom of the screen shows how many miles he did last week and how many this week.
